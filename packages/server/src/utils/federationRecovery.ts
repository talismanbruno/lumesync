 * AUTH-FAILURE path — its HTTP is up and returning 401/403 because the new
 * incarnation has no peer row for us, so `consecutive_auth_failures` crosses
 * `AUTH_FAILURE_THRESHOLD` — WITHOUT ever transitioning through `unreachable`.
 * The `unreachable`-only recovery probe (`processRecoveryTick`) therefore never
 * sees such a peer, so its epoch change is never observed and no
 * `federation_reset_events` journal is ever created. A later manual admin
 * Re-peer would then run `healResetIncarnation` with no journal row → no heal →
 * the stale-friendship / split-DM split-brain persists for this sub-case. This
 * pass probes those peers so the journal is created at detection time.
 *
 * **Detection only — never a recover-to-active.** Unlike `recoverOrDetectReset`,
 * this NEVER flips a peer to `active`: a `needs_attention` peer's HMAC secret is
 * desynced, so a matching or unknown epoch means "still broken, still needs an
 * admin," not "recovered." On an observed epoch mismatch it calls
 * `markPeerReset` (snapshot + journal + admin notify) and nothing else; the
 * trusted baseline (`peer_instance_id`) and `hmac_secret` are left untouched.
 * On a match / unknown / unreachable result it does nothing at all.
 *
 * Candidate set (deliberately small — one `/instance/info` GET per peer per
 * tick): `status='needs_attention'` AND `peer_instance_id IS NOT NULL` (a null
 * baseline has nothing to compare against) AND the reason is not already
 * `peer_reset_detected` (those peers already carry a journal — re-probing would
 * be wasted work). Peers whose reason is `auth_failures` or NULL qualify.
