# Design System — "Aether Drift"

Prototype (source of truth): `Backspace-design-prototype.html` (open in browser)
Styles: `packages/web/src/styles/globals.css`
Theme: `packages/web/tailwind.config.js`
Font: DM Sans (primary) with system fallbacks

---

## Principles

- Calm over flashy. Warm over cool.
- Quiet glass (felt, not seen). No decorative gradients. Minimal shadows.
- Two-material system: solid matte panels for content (75%), frosted glass bubbles for persistent controls (25%)
- `prefers-reduced-transparency` → fall back to solid surfaces
- NOT a Discord clone — Backspace has its own visual identity

## Surface Material Tiers

| Tier | Class | When to Use |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Structural | `bg-surface-*` | Permanent layout (sidebars, chat, member list) |
| Strip | `.glass-strip` | Persistent edge chrome (space sidebar) |
| Bubble | `.glass-bubble` | Persistent floating controls (voice bar, **chat composer**, voice mini-bar). Chat composer is a floating bubble on **both** desktop and mobile (`position: absolute`, sits above the message-list scroll area; messages scroll behind it). On mobile, its `bottom` value is driven by `useVisualViewportInset()` so it lifts above the iOS soft keyboard when one is open. See `docs/systems/mobile-ui.md` "Floating Composer" for the full pattern. |
| Popover | `.glass` | Small floating surfaces (context menus, popovers, tooltips) |
| Tray dropdown | `.glass` (popover) | `TransferIndicator` global panel — anchored under the channel-header icon. |
| Modal | `.glass-modal` | Large center-screen dialogs |
| Pill | `.glass-pill` | Inline decorations (reactions, tags) |
| Pill (own) | `.glass-pill-mine` | User's own reaction (mint-tinted) |

**Rule:** If it floats above the content plane, it's glass. Never use `bg-surface-elevated` for floating/overlay elements.

**Modal backdrops:** `bg-black/50` — light enough for glass blur to show through.

**Portal target — `usePortalContainer()`:** Every overlay (context menu, tooltip, popover, modal, screen-share picker) MUST portal through `usePortalContainer()` (`packages/web/src/hooks/usePortalContainer.ts`) instead of hard-coding `document.body`. The hook returns `document.fullscreenElement ?? document.body` and re-renders subscribers on `fullscreenchange`. Without this, anything portaled while an element (e.g. the voice container in fullscreen mode) is in the browser's Fullscreen API top-layer is rendered outside that layer and is invisible. Components mounted at App root that render with `fixed inset-0` (not just portals) must also portal through this hook for the same reason.

### Glass Material Properties
```css
.glass {
  backdrop-filter: blur(20px) saturate(120%);
  background: rgba(20, 20, 26, 0.52);    /* --glass-bg */
  border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.07);  /* --glass-border */
}
.glass-modal {
  /* Higher opacity: 82%, stronger shadow */
}
.glass-pill {
  backdrop-filter: blur(12px) saturate(110%);
}
```

## Input Tiers

All defined in `globals.css`. No resting border — sunken `surface-input` background provides differentiation.

| Tier | Class | When to Use | Focus |
|------|-------|-------------|-------|
| Standard | `.input-standard` | Form fields in modals, settings, auth | `ring-2` primary |
| Search | `.input-search` | Search bars, filter inputs | `ring-1` primary |
| Embedded | `.input-embedded` | Inside glass (chat input, search popover) | none |
| Danger | `.input-danger` | Destructive confirmations | `ring-2` rose |

Override padding/size with utilities: `input-standard w-full py-2.5`

### iOS Auto-Zoom Suppression

iOS Safari auto-zooms (and shifts the viewport right) on input focus when the computed `font-size` is below 16px. The `@media (max-width: 767px)` block in `globals.css` bumps every input tier — and bare `<input>`/`<textarea>`/`<select>` plus `[contenteditable]` — to `font-size: 16px !important`.

`!important` is required because Tailwind utilities like `text-[15px]` (used on the chat composer textarea) and `text-sm` (used on form fields) are emitted in the `@layer utilities` block, which comes after `@layer components` in the cascade and would otherwise override the input-tier rules. There is no legitimate reason to use a `<16px` font-size on a mobile input, so the override is universally correct.

When introducing a new input or contenteditable surface, no extra work is needed — the global rule covers it.

## Layout

3-column grid: 312px channel sidebar | main content | 240px members sidebar
Glass server strip overlays left 72px of channel sidebar.
Channel sidebar fully opaque with gradient at left edge feeding glass.

## Shadows

| Name | Use |
|------|-----|
| `header` | Top bars |
| `elevation-low` | Subtle lift |
| `elevation-high` | Dropdowns, popovers |
| `glass` | Glass surfaces |
| `input` | Input fields |

---

## Animations

### Core
`fadeIn`, `slideUp`, `slideDown`, `typingFadeIn`, `gradientPulse`, `shimmer` (skeleton loading)

### Search
`search-flash`, `stepForward`, `stepBack`

### Call
`callRippleLiquid`, `callGlowSoft`, `callRefraction`, `callButtonBreath`

### Mobile

## Utility Classes

- `.no-scrollbar` — Hides scrollbars
- `.scrollbar-thin` — 4px thin scrollbars
- `.rounded-inherit` — Inherits border radius
- `.titlebar-drag` / `.titlebar-no-drag` — Electron window drag
- `.call-refraction` — Light shimmer overlay for call UI

---

## Primitives

### Radial Progress Ring

Used in `AttachmentProgress` overlays inside the optimistic bubble and the staged-files row. Implementation:

```css
background: conic-gradient(rgba(180, 220, 200, .85) <pct>%, rgba(255, 255, 255, .15) <pct>%);
```

Inner disk uses `bg-surface-overlay` to sit visually above the underlying tile thumbnail. Failed-state ring uses `bg-accent-rose/30`.

### AvatarStack

Reusable group-DM identity widget at `packages/web/src/components/ui/AvatarStack.tsx`. Replaces the bespoke inline avatar logic that previously lived in `DmListItem`. Single source of truth for any rendered group-DM identity slot — sidebar rows, chat header, welcome header, settings modal hero, and mobile equivalents all consume it.

```ts
interface AvatarStackProps {
  members: User[];                        // already filtered to "other" members
  size: number;                           // outer box edge length in px (24, 32, 40, 56, 80)
  border: 'channel' | 'chat' | 'modal';   // surface tier the stack sits on; controls tile border color
  iconUrl?: string | null;                // when set, renders the icon as a single image and ignores the stack
}
```

**Layout rules** (chosen by `members.length`, ignored entirely when `iconUrl` is set):

| Member count | Layout | `data-avatar-stack-layout` |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Empty placeholder + small 12×12 group badge bottom-right | — |
| 1 | Single avatar centered in the box + 12×12 group badge bottom-right (distinguishes a 1-other-member group from a 1-on-1 DM) | — |
| 2 | Two avatars at 70% size with a 30% offset overlap (z-stacked) | `overlap` |
| 3 | Equilateral-triangle huddle: three 62%-size tiles arranged radially (top, bottom-right, bottom-left), neighbors overlap | `triangle` |
| 4 | Diamond huddle: four 58%-size tiles at the four cardinal points (top, right, bottom, left), neighbors overlap | `diamond` |
| 5-10 | Diamond huddle: three 58%-size tiles at the top/right/left points + a `+N` overflow tile occupying the bottom point, where `N = members.length - 3` | `diamond` |

**3+ member geometry.** Tiles are positioned radially around the box center on a circle of radius `R = (S − T) / 2`, where `S` is the box edge length and `T` is the tile size (`0.62·S` for 3 members, `0.58·S` for 4+). The first slot starts at `−90°` (top) and remaining slots are evenly spaced clockwise (`360° / slotCount` apart). This makes the farthest edges of each tile graze the box's bounding rect — no clipping, no wasted whitespace — and produces the same "huddle of overlapping faces" aesthetic as the 2-member overlap pattern at every member count. Z-index descends clockwise from the top slot so each tile tucks slightly under its clockwise neighbor (mirrors the 2-member case where the first tile sits on top of the second). The `+N` overflow tile always occupies the bottom diamond slot — reads as "more members behind these three" rather than "+N is one of the people".

`iconUrl` accepts a bare filename (resolved to `/api/uploads/<filename>`) or an absolute URL (`http`, `blob:`, `data:`, or `/`-prefixed) — passed through unchanged. When set, the entire box renders as a single rounded `<img>` filling the box.

**Status dots are deliberately omitted** regardless of member count — a group is a group. The 1-on-1 path keeps its presence dot via the direct `Avatar` component.

**Hooks-in-loop safety:** each rendered slot is its own `<AvatarTile>` component so `useCanonicalUserView` is called exactly once per slot, never inside a variable-length `.map()`.

**Tile geometry contract.** Each `AvatarTile` renders at `size × size` with a 2px border (`box-sizing: border-box` from Tailwind preflight), so its content area is `(size − 4) × (size − 4)`. The inner `Avatar` is sized to that content area (`size − 2 · TILE_BORDER_WIDTH`) and centered geometrically on the tile via `flex items-center justify-center`, **not** by inline-flow placement. Both corrections are required: sizing the Avatar to the outer dimensions overflows the padding box and gets clipped off-center (visible disc remains centered, but the avatar's contents — image crop, initials gradient + letter — anchor at the padding-edge top-left and visibly drift toward the lower-right of the visible disc); relying on `Avatar`'s `inline-flex` placement makes the Avatar drift vertically by whatever the inherited `line-height` adds, independent of border. `TILE_BORDER_WIDTH` is exported from `AvatarStack.tsx` as the single source of truth for the `border-2` width and must be updated in lockstep with any future change to that class.

**Border tiers:** the surface tier the stack sits on determines the tile border color (so the tiles cleanly separate from the panel they overlap). `channel` → `border-surface-channel` (sidebar); `chat` → `border-surface-chat` (chat area / welcome header / chat header); `modal` → `border-surface-elevated` (modal hero, mobile info-screen hero — there is no `surface-modal` token in `tailwind.config.js`).

**Usage sites** (all six call sites in the codebase):

| Site | Size | Border | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `DmListItem.tsx` (sidebar row) | 32 | `channel` | Pinned to the DM sidebar; `iconUrl={dm.icon}` |
| `MessageList.tsx` `WelcomeHeader` (group-DM branch) | 80 | `chat` | Large hero on the empty-state header |
| `MainContent.tsx` chat header (group-DM branch) | 32 | `chat` | Replaces the people-icon for group DMs |
| `GroupDmSettings.tsx` (modal hero + member-row previews) | varies | `modal` | Modal Overview tab |
| `MobileGroupDmInfo.tsx` (pushed-screen hero) | 80 | `modal` | Mobile info screen hero |
| `MobileDmsScreen.tsx` (DM list rows) | 40 | `channel` | Mobile sidebar parity with desktop `DmListItem` |

### Profile name appearance

`ProfileName` and identity-aware `Username` share the profile-owned `nameColor` across chat, calls, member lists, friends, DMs and profile surfaces, with white as the default. They subscribe narrowly to canonical user-view and self color changes. Role/group labels keep their role colors but no longer implicitly tint names. Admin gold uses a static metallic text gradient with a restrained glow; it runs no continuous animation. AccountPanel shows unsaved choices in its profile preview.

`WhatsNew` presents curated release highlights once per canonical account/release after authentication, remembers explicit dismissal locally with a session fallback, and can be reopened from desktop/mobile settings. The dialog uses the fullscreen-aware portal, keyboard focus containment, viewport scrolling and no continuous background animation.
