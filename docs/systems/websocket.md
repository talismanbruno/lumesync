# WebSocket Protocol Reference

Endpoint: `GET /ws` (upgrade to WebSocket)
Transport: JSON messages over WebSocket
Source: `packages/server/src/ws/handler.ts`, `packages/server/src/ws/events.ts`

## Auth Flow

1. Client connects to `/ws`
2. Client sends `{ type: 'auth', token: '<jwt>' }` within 10 seconds
3. Server validates token (rejects deleted users, tokens issued before `passwordChangedAt`)
4. Server responds with `ready` event containing full client state
5. Server restores visible presence from the saved `preferred_status` (including Invisible), broadcasts `presence_update` to friends + DM co-members + space co-members (via `collectProfileBroadcastTargetIds`); for native users, also queues a S2S `presence_update` relay with the restored status. The ready self-view user includes `preferredStatus`.
6. Heartbeat: server pings every 30s (RFC 6455 ping frames), dead connections detected after ~65s

### Federation
| type | fields | scope |
|------|--------|-------|
| `federation_file_rejected` | messageId, dmChannelId, attachmentId, affectedUsers[] | DM members |
| `federation_approval_request_received` | — (refetch trigger; payload: `{ type }`) | admins. Fires for **both** inbound peering requests (remote → us) AND outbound queue creation when the [Outbound Peering Gate](federation.md#outbound-peering-gate) creates a `peer_approval_requests` row in response to a user_action. Payload shape unchanged from the inbound-only behavior; only the firing surface widened. |
| `federation_peer_reset_detected` | `{ origin: string }` | admins. Fires from `markPeerReset` when a peer's advertised instance epoch differs from the trusted baseline (a wipe-and-reinstall on the same domain — see [Reset Detection](federation.md#reset-detection-markpeerreset--utilsfederationresetts)). Detection-only: the peer was routed to `needs_attention` (reason `peer_reset_detected`) with no rekey/tombstone. Paired with a `federation_peers_changed` broadcast. **Client handler:** `onFederationPeerResetDetected(cb)` (`useWebSocket.ts`) — the FederationPanel's Reset-cleanup surface subscribes and refetches `GET /api/federation/peers` + `GET /api/federation/reset-events`, raising a persistent banner with one-click Re-peer (see `admin.md` "FederationPanel", `client-federation.md` §8). |
| `peering_subscription_changed` | — (refetch trigger; payload: `{ type }`) | the subscribing user (all of their connected sessions). Fires when a `peer_approval_subscribers` row belonging to the user is created, modified, or deleted (gate fan-in, user cancel, parent cascade). Client refetches `GET /api/federation/peering-subscriptions`. |
| `peering_notification_received` | `{ type, kind: 'approved' \| 'denied' \| 'expired' }` | the user the notification belongs to. Fires when a `peer_approval_notifications` row is created (`onPeerActivated` outbound fanout, outbound `/deny` fanout, janitor outbound expiry). Client refetches `GET /api/federation/peering-notifications` and may surface a transient toast for online users. |

**S2S relay-only event (not a direct client WS event):**

`read_state_update` — sent peer-to-peer via the federation relay when a user acknowledges a DM channel on one instance. The receiving instance processes it, upserts the `read_states` row, and then emits a standard `channel_ack` event to the user's local WebSocket connections. The relay event itself is never forwarded to clients directly.

## Ready Payload

```typescript
{
  type: 'ready',
  user: User,
  spaces: SpaceWithChannelsAndMembers[],
  dmChannels: DmChannel[],
  folders?: SpaceFolder[],
  spaceLayout?: SpaceLayoutItem[] | null,
  layoutUpdatedAt?: number,
  voiceStates?: Record<channelId, userId[]>,
  voiceUserStates?: Record<string, { isMuted, isDeafened, isCameraOn, isScreenSharing }>,
  spaceVoiceStates?: Record<string, { spaceMuted, spaceDeafened, permissionMuted }>,
  readStates?: ReadState[],
  activeCalls?: ActiveCallInfo[],  // includes federatedCallHost?, livekitUrl?, livekitToken? for federated calls
  userActivities?: Record<userId, Activity[]>,
  rejectedPeerOrigins: string[],         // origins with status 'rejected'; used for DM unreachable indicators
  awaitingApprovalPeerOrigins: string[], // origins with status 'awaiting_approval'
  pendingApprovalCount: number           // count of peer_approval_requests rows; only non-zero for admins
}
```

**Federation filtering:** When the connecting user is federated (`homeInstance` is set), the server omits all DM-related data from the ready payload. `dmChannels` and `activeCalls` are sent as empty arrays, and `readStates` is filtered to only include space channel entries. Federated users receive their DM data from their home instance's ready payload instead.

**Voice-state assembly:** `voiceStates` / `voiceUserStates` / `spaceVoiceStates` for each of the user's spaces are produced by `ConnectionManager.buildSpaceVoiceState(spaceId, userId)` — the single source of truth shared with the mid-session join push (see below). Voice presence is VIEW_CHANNEL-filtered per `computePermissions`: a user is never told who occupies a voice channel they cannot see.

### Mid-session space join — `space_voice_state` push

The `ready` payload is the **only** carrier of voice presence at connect time. When a user joins a space *mid-session* (invite, public join, or join-request approval) without reloading, they would otherwise see empty voice channels until a refresh, because `member_joined` carries no voice state and `GET /api/spaces/:id` (the channel-sidebar hydrator) has none either.

To close this, `ConnectionManager.addUserSpace(userId, spaceId)` — the single chokepoint every join path funnels through, and which is **not** used on reconnect (that path uses `setUserSpaces`) — builds the same per-space snapshot via `buildSpaceVoiceState` and pushes it to the joining user as a `space_voice_state` event. Delivery rides the same ordered WebSocket as the `voice_state_update` deltas, so there is no snapshot-vs-stream race. The push is skipped when the space has no active voice and no restrictions (e.g. space creation). The client applies it scoped to `spaceId` (`utils/voiceStateSync.applySpaceVoiceState`): it merges occupants/statuses and rebuilds only that space's restriction keys, never disturbing voice state in other spaces.
