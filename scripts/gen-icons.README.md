# Icon Generator

Regenerates every brand artefact from sources in `assets/brand/`:

- macOS `.icns`, Windows `.ico`, Linux per-size PNGs (`packages/desktop/build/`)
- Tray icons for all three platforms (`packages/desktop/resources/`)
- Web favicons, PWA manifest icons, maskable, in-app `logo.png` (`packages/web/public/icons/`)

## When to run

After changing any file under `assets/brand/`, **or** after bumping `sharp`,
`png-to-ico`, or `png2icons` in the root `package.json`. Commit the diff in
the same PR.

```bash
pnpm gen-icons
git status                       # review which files changed
git add packages/desktop/build/ packages/desktop/resources/ packages/web/public/icons/
git commit -m "chore: regenerate brand icons"
```

(Stage explicit paths rather than `git add -A` — the generator only writes to those three directories, and an unrelated working-tree change shouldn't accidentally land in a "regenerate icons" commit.)

## Determinism

To update only the Windows application and notification-area icons:

```bash
pnpm gen-icons --windows-only
```

Both Windows ICO files use the normal, full Lume logo, including its dark
rounded background. The tray ICO contains 16, 20, 24, 32, 40 and 48 px versions
so Windows can pick the appropriate resolution for the display scale.

Output is byte-stable for a given lockfile. The same SVGs in produce the
same PNG/ICO/ICNS bytes out, every time, on every OS — Sharp uses resvg
internally and writes deterministic PNGs, png-to-ico and png2icons don't
embed timestamps.

**Caveat:** byte-stability is *not* guaranteed across version bumps of
the three encoder deps. After a Renovate / dependabot PR upgrades any of
them, run `pnpm gen-icons` once and commit the resulting diff inside the
same PR. That follow-up commit isn't an artwork change — it's encoder
output drift, and gating it inside the dep PR keeps the artwork-change
git history clean.

## Sources

Every app-icon output renders from the 3D-rendered raster sources — including favicons and the small `.ico` / Linux reps. The flat `app-icon.svg` is retained as a source but no longer rendered: at favicon sizes its gradient mark's bright sheen runs to the badge perimeter and anti-aliases into a white halo that reads as a border around the icon (reported in Safari tabs; same defect in small Windows/Linux reps). The closest-fit picker selects the smallest raster source whose native dimension is ≥ the target output size, so every output is a downscale — no upscale anywhere. See `RASTER_THRESHOLD` in `gen-icons.mjs` for the gate.

| Brand source                       | Drives                                                                              |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `assets/brand/app-icon.svg`        | Retained as the flat archival source; not rendered (gated off — see `RASTER_THRESHOLD`). Re-enable only with a corrected flat mark whose sheen stops short of the perimeter. |
| `assets/brand/app-icon-x1.png` (149) | App-icon outputs ≤149 (favicons 16/32, Linux 16/32/48/64/128, Windows application `.ico` 16/24/32/48/64/128 and all Windows tray reps) |
| `assets/brand/app-icon-x2.png` (294) | App-icon outputs >149 and ≤294 (Linux 256, Windows `.ico` 256 rep, apple-touch 180, PWA 192, in-app `logo.png` 256) |
| `assets/brand/app-icon-x3.png` (440) | App-icon outputs >294 and ≤440 (currently unused — reserved for future intermediate targets) |
| `assets/brand/app-icon-1024.png`     | App-icon outputs >440 (Linux 512, Linux 1024, `build/icon.png` 512, PWA 512, `.icns` synthesis input 1024) |
| `assets/brand/mark.svg`              | Linux tray, PWA maskable inner mark                                                |
| `assets/brand/mark-mono-dark.svg`    | macOS menu-bar template (alpha + black)                                            |

After raster resize, every app-icon raster output is masked with a 22 %-radius rounded-square (matches Apple's macOS template ratio and the existing `app-icon.svg` geometry of `rx=32.42 / 147.46 ≈ 21.99 %`) so launchers/docks/homescreens that render the icon as-is produce the rounded silhouette they expect.

`Artworks-Backspace/` is the design archive — never read by this script.
